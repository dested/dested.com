The engine is a strict TypeScript application that achieves rendering at 60fps using canvas.<br/><br/>Many performance tricks were employed to hit the 60fps goal such as using multiple canvases for different layers, storing the screens pixels in a typed array and using putImageData vs drawImage, and culling every pixel possible during draw. The API is hosted serverless using AWS API Gateway and Lambda.",
