          A day/week/month long game played out over the course of several hundred or thousand of turns.
          <br /> <br />
          You enter the game automatically joining one of three "factions". Your faction owns a subset of the map, and
          has units that can be controlled. <br /> <br />
          The gimmick is, you can’t control any one unit yourself. Instead you have the power to vote to make a unit do
          a certain action: move, attack, create a new unit, mine, etc. You will have some number of votes per round,
          probably 5 or so. <br /> <br />
          At the end of the round (probably every 1 minute for fast paced games, or 5 minutes for slower paced games),
          all the votes are tallied and the winning action on each unit is enacted. This will force players (ideally
          hundreds on each side) to vote strategically together to do what is best for each unit. Your actions are kept
          track of and show up on the leaderboard appropriately, things like how many rounds you played, how many units
          you’ve created, resources mined, damage done, etc.

          As stated above: Twitch extensions are magic. Also as the channel I get 100% of the bits spent, which means I

          Also the technical aspect was delicious. I needed to be able to stream a webpage to a twitch channel 24 hours
          a day via aws. The jumping action is also done completely serverlessly which means I could literally support
          100k players without a hiccup, just exorbitant cost (which is mitigated by the bits). <br />
